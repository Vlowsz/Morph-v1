# LINE Front-end Framework

LINE Front-end Framework (LIFF) is a platform for web apps provided by LINE.
The web apps running on this platform are called LIFF apps.

LIFF apps can get data from the LINE Platform such as the LINE user ID.
The LIFF app can use such data to provide features that utilize user information and send messages on the user's behalf.

## Installation
Using npm
```
$ npm install --save @line/liff
```

Using yarn
```
$ yarn add @line/liff
```

**Note:** It is the developer's responsibility to use an appropriate SDK version. To keep your SDK version up to date, check the [LIFF release notes](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/release-notes/#liff-version-and-release-date) on a regular basis, and update your local SDK frequently. For more information about LIFF's versioning policy, see [LIFF SDK (sdk.js) update policy](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/versioning-policy/#update-policy).

## Usage

Include the SDK in your JavaScript or TypeScript files:
```ts
import liff from '@line/liff';

liff.init({ liffID: 'myLiffId' });
```

*Type definitions for TypeScript are already included in the `@line/liff` package*

### CDN
The LIFF SDK is also available on LINE's CDN.
